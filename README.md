This is a successor to [MonkeModManager](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/MonkeModManager) that:
- Remains fully compatable with all MMM mods (including MakeRelease.ps1)
- Has it's own catalog and filtering system that includes the original MMM mod list
- Can detect what mods are installed based off of the filename or certain keywords in the naming scheme and update them accordingly

## FAQ
### I want my mod added / removed
For additions, send a PR to [MMDictionary](https://github.com/binguszingus/MMDictionary), and most of the time, it'll get accepted.
For removals, send a PR to [MMDictionary](https://github.com/binguszingus/MMDictionary), or DM me on Discord ``stickmaster10`` and I'll remove it personally.

### Why is there a ``setup.exe``?
It is there for convenience. I am also providing a plain .exe build incase you may think it's sketchy.

### Is this a rat?
You can read the source at any time. No.
